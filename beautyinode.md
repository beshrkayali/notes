## How to Build an Analyst: James Bach

- A deterministic process that solves a specific problem entirely within formal system is an algorithm, not a heuristic.

- Fallibility implies that wisdom and responsibility are critical.

- Why is it dangerous to treat heuristics as "best practices?":

    - Best Practices always shout: "Shut up and do what I say." Replace it with "Practice". Best practices are simply commandments.
    (There's pressure in best practices when there's not enough time, not to do the work, but to follow the practice).

    - Commandments are mechanical, uncontrolled, and binary: "do or not do."

    - Anything beyond "just doing it" is therefore illegible, invisible, and seemingly gratuitous.

    - Thus, the analyst is invented to use any "commanded heuristic" in the cheapest, laziest way...

    - ... and to have no concern for outcome.

    - This syndrome is very common.

- Pathetic Compliance: Following the rules even though it's hurting.

- Responsibilty: I Choose to help and not harm.
- Wisdom: I know how my decisions might help or harm.
- Freedom: I am able to make decisions that may help or harm.

- Responsibilty and wisdom require freedom to develop. Analysis without freedom is nothing but marketing.


- Explicit knowledge means it can be represented completely in the form of a string of bits: words, pictrures, even actions can be explicit. (Sottware explicit)
- Tacit knowledge means it is not manifested in a form that can be equated to a string of bits: it is unspoken, unwritten, unpictured.

- Relational Tacit Knowldge is tacit by convenience.
- Somatic Tacit knowledge is tacit in your body.
- Collective Tacit Knowledge is tacit in your community. 

- The Explicit World is not the part that gets the job done, but we need it to access tacit skills.

- Respect for agency and self-integrity.
- The importance of empathy and socialization.
